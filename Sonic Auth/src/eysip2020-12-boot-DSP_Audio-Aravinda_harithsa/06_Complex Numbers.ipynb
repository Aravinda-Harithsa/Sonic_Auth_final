    "Complex numbers are an extension of the ordinary numbers which we use in mathematics . They have the unique property of representing and manipulating two variables as a single quantity together.

Complex numbers will reduce the size of  equations used in DSP and enable techniques that are difficult or impossible with real numbers alone.\n",
