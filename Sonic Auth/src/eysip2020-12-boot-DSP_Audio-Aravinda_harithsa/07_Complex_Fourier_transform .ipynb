    "From these equations we can see that the real DFT is computed by projecting the signal on cosine and sine basis functions. However, the complex DFT projects the input signal on exponential basis functions (Euler’s formula connects these two concepts).When the input signal in the time domain is real valued, the complex DFT zero-fills the imaginary part during computation (That’s its flexibility and avoids the caveat needed for real DFT). The following figure shows how to interpret the raw FFT results in Matlab that computes complex DFT. The specifics will be discussed next with an example.\n",

These are not really complex numbers but are the amplitudes of the basis functions (cosine and sine waves) that can be combined to make up the time domain signal. Since they are the amplitudes of cosine and sine basis functions they can be treated as the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers through substitution. One purpose of doing this is to convert them into polar form by creating N/2 + 1 size magnitude and phase vectors  from the complex numbers, giving the magnitude and phase of the frequency response.\n",
