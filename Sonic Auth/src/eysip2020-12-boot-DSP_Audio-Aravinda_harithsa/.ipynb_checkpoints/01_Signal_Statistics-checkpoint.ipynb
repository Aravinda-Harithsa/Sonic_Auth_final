Unfortunately, most acquired signals do not show a well defined peak-to-peak value, but have a random nature.\n",

    "\n",
    "The average AC power quantity of a signal is directly proportional to the variance simply the average of the squares.This relation to \"power\" is clear when considering electrical signals of current or voltage. The total power is due to the DC component and AC component. By definition of variance, the DC component is subtracted from the signal prior to taking the average of the squares, and thus is the power of the \"AC\" component only. Often in communications our concern is with AC as that is where the information content is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of the variance is the **standard deviation**. The RMS  of a signal is the standard deviation of the DC component is removed. Notice that the power due to a DC signal at level X is the same as an AC signal with RMS (standard deviation) level X. Thus for AC signals, including noisy signals with no DC component, the standard deviation is often the magnitude quantity for that signal.\n",

    "The SNR (Signal-To-Noise Ratio) of a system or component is defined as the ratio of signal level to the noise level. SNR is expressed in decibels. It is calculated by dividing the signal power by the noise power. A ratio bigger than 1 dB indicates that the signal is more than the noise. Conversely, if the ratio is less than 1, it indicates that the noise level is bigger than the signal level.If the power of the signal is less than the power of the noise, i.e. the SNR < 1, the signal becomes unusable.Signal-to-noise ratio is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise\n",
